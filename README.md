Methods:
__init__() initializes attributes.
display() prints the basic personnel details.
Doctor Class: Inherits from Personnel and adds the specialty attribute.

Nurse Class: Inherits from Personnel and adds the rank attribute.
Method: displayNurse() prints the Nurse's details including name, age, hourly rate, and rank.
Technologies Used
